# odin-recipes

This is a project to demonstrate the HTML Foundations, all the things that I've learned across the first part of the The Odin Project's course. 

In this project I'll do a web page of recipes that will contain links to other pages inside the index page. I will be applying all the contents I've acquired such as: writing the HTML boilerplate, putting the meta data in the head, creating and running a web through hypertext (i.e. links), images and paragraphs of text.
